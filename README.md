# Learning data structures and algorithms - with Javascript 🔥
- Algorithm: method for solving a problem.
- Data structure: method to store information
> Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs.

## Why learn algorithm 👨🏻‍💻

1. Their impact is broad and far-reaching.
- Internet. Web search, packet routing, distributed file sharing, ...
- Biology. Human genome project, protein folding, ...
- Computers. Circuit layout, file system, compilers, ...
- Computer graphics. Movies, video games, virtual reality, ...
- Security. Cell phones, e-commerce, voting machines, ...
- Multimedia. MP3, JPG, DivX, HDTV, face recognition, ...
- Social networks. Recommendations, news feeds, advertisements, ...
- Physics. N-body simulation, particle collision simulation, ...

2. To solve problems that could not otherwise be addressed 🐞

Ex. Network connectivity

3. To become a proficient programmer 🕺

```
“ I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer
 and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures
 more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good
 programmers worry about data structures and their relationships. ”
 — Linus Torvalds (creator of Linux)
```
4. For intellectual stimulation 😎

5. They may unlock the secrets of life and of the universe 🤯
