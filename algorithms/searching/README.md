# Searching algorithm

## Objective

- Describe what a searching algorithm is
- Implement linear search on arrays
- Implement binary search on sorted arrays
- Implement a naive string searching algorithm
- Implement the KMP string searching algorithm

## Linear search
Given an array, the simplest way to search for an value is to look at every element in the array and check if it's the value we want.

### Pseudocode

- This function accepts an array and a value
- Loop through the array and check if the current array element is equal to the value
- If it is, return the index at which the element is found
- If the value is never found, return -1

### Big O

- Worst: O(n)
- Best: O(1)
- Average: O(n)
