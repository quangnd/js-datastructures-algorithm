## What do they do

- Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## Why?

- Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.
- The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures
- There is no one "BEST" data structure. They all excel in different situations.

## Examples

[ ] Please add images later...

- Working with map/location data? **Use a graph!**
- Need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end? **Use a linked list!**
- Web scraping nested HTML? **Use a tree!**
- Need to write a scheduler? **Use a binary heap!**

## Notes

> Don't get overwhelmed trying to master it all at once.

- You need at least two weeks, 8 - 10 hours per day to study.
- You just need to know a bit of ES6 syntax to follow the examples. Check out `Introduction folder`.
