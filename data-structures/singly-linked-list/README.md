# Singly Linked Lists

## Objective

1. Define what a Singly Linked List is.
2. Compare and contrast Linked Lists with Arrays.
3. Implement **insertion**, **removal** and **traversal** methods on Singly Linked Lists.

## 1. What is a linked list?

- A data structure that contains a **head**, **tail** and **length** property.
- Linked Lists consist of **nodes**, and each node has a **value** and a **pointer** to another node or *null*

- * ðŸ‘» **Analogy**: Sort of a chain of elephants, back before that band elephants at the circus, they would grab each other's tails with their nodes and walk in line.*

## 2. Comparisons with Arrays

| **Lists** | **Arrays** |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Do not have indexes!                     | Indexed in order!  |
| Connected via nodes with a next pointer  | Insertion and deletion can be expensive  |
| Random access is not allowed             | Can quickly be accessed at a specific index  |
