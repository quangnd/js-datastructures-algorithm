# Singly Linked Lists

## Objective

1. Define what a Singly Linked List is
2. Compare and contrast Linked Lists with Arrays
3. Implement insertion, removal and traversal methods on Singly Linked Lists

## What is a linked list?

- A data structure that contains a **head**, **tail** and **length** property.
- Linked Lists consist of **nodes**, and each node has a **value** and a **pointer** to another node or *null*

## Comparisons with Arrays

| **Lists** | **Arrays** |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Do not have indexes!                     | Indexed in order!  |
| Connected via nodes with a next pointer  | Insertion and deletion can be expensive  |
| Random access is not allowed             | Can quickly be accessed at a specific index  |
