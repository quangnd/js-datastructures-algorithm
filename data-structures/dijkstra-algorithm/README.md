# Dijkastra's Algorithm

## Objectives

- Understand the importance of Dijkstra's.
- Implement a Weighted Graph.
- Walk through the steps of Dijkstra's.
- Implement Dijkstra's using a naive priority queue.
- Implement Dijkstra's using a binary heap priority queue.

## What is it

- One of the most famous and widely used algorithms around!
- Finds the shortest path between two vertices on a graph.
- "What's the fastest way to get from point A to point B?".

## Why is it useful?

- GPS - finding fastest route.
- Network Routing - finds open shortest path for data.
- Biology - used to model the spread of viruses among humans.
- Airline tickets - finding cheapest route to your destination.
- Many other uses!

## Test

- Run `ava --verbose ./data-structures/dijkstra-algorithm/weighted-graph.test.js`
